<details>
<summary><b>🚨 CLICK FOR RULE BREAKDOWN 🚨</b></summary>

#### 🛤️ **Path Creation Rules**
```
Rule #1: Connect 🛸 (Spaceship) → 🌍 (Earth)
Rule #2: Arrows show WHERE you can travel FROM that tile
Rule #3: You can only move UP ⬆️ DOWN ⬇️ LEFT ⬅️ RIGHT ➡️ (No teleporting!)
```

#### ⚡ **Arrow Mechanics** (The Tricky Part!)
```
🔄 ROTATE: Spins the tile pattern (straight→corner→T-junction)
⚡ CHANGE ARROWS: Flips all arrows on that tile
```

#### 🎯 **Scoring Psychology**
```
😎 "I'll just click randomly" 
   → 5000 moves later → 😭 "Why is my score so low?"

🧠 "Let me think strategically"  
   → Optimal moves → 🏆 "I AM THE CHOSEN ONE!"
```
